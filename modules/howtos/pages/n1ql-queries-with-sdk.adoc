[abstract]
You can query for documents in Couchbase using the N1QL query language, a language based on SQL, but designed for structured and flexible JSON documents.
Querying can solve typical programming tasks such as finding a user profile by email address, facebook login, or user ID.

Our query service uses N1QL, which will be fairly familiar to anyone who's used any dialect of SQL.
xref:#additional-resources[Further resources] for learning about N1QL are listed at the bottom of the page.
Before you get started you may wish to checkout the xref:6.5@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[N1QL intro page], or just dive in with a query against our "travel-sample" data set.
In this case, note that before you can query a bucket, you must define at least one index.
You can define a _primary_ index on a bucket.
When a primary index is defined you can issue non-covered queries on the bucket as well.

Use
xref:6.5@server::tools/cbq-shell.html[cbq], our interactive Query shell.
Open it, and enter the following:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `travel-sample`
----

or replace _travel-sample_ with a different Bucket name to build an index on a different dataset.

NOTE: The default installation places cbq in `/opt/couchbase/bin/` on Linux, `/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbq` on OS X, and `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbq.exe` on Microsoft Windows.

== Queries & Placeholders

Placeholders allow you to specify variable constraints for an otherwise constant query.
There are two variants of placeholders: postional and named parameters.
Positional parameters use an ordinal placeholder for substitution and named parameters use variables.
A named or positional parameter is a placeholder for a value in the WHERE, LIMIT or OFFSET clause of a query.
Note that both parameters and options are optional.

.Positional parameter example:

.Named parameter example:

The `QueryMetaData` provides insight into some basic profiling/timing information as well as information like the `ClientContextID`.

.QueryMetaData
[options="header"]
|====
| Name       | Description
| `RequestID string` | Returns the request identifer of this request.
| `ClientContextID string` | Returns the context ID either generated by the SDK or supplied by the user.
| `Status QueryStatus` | An enum simply representing the state of the result.
| `Metrics QueryMetrics` | Returns metrics provided by the query for the request if enabled.
| `Signature interface{}` | If a signature is present, it will be available to consume in a generic fashion.
| `Warnings []QueryWarning` | Non-fatal errors are available to consume as warnings on this method.
| `Profile interface{}` | If enabled returns additional profiling information of the query.
|====

== Handling Results

In most cases your query will return more than one result, and you may be looking to iterate over those results:

== Query Options
The query service provides an array of options to customize your query. The following table lists them all:

.Available Query Options
[options="header"]
|====
| Name       | Description
| `ClientContextID string` | Sets a context ID returned by the service for debugging purposes.
| `PositionalParameters []interface{}` | Allows to set positional arguments for a parameterized query.
| `NamedParameters map[string]interface{}` | Allows to set named arguments for a parameterized query.
| `Raw interface{}` | Escape hatch to add arguments that are not covered by these options.
| `ReadOnly bool` | Tells the client and server that this query is readonly.
| `Adhoc bool` | If set to false will prepare the query and later execute the prepared statement.
| `ConsistentWith MutationState` | Allows to be consistent with previously written mutations ("read your own writes").
| `MaxParallelism uint32` | Tunes the maximum parallelism on the server.
| `Metrics bool` | Enables the server to send metrics back to the client as part of the response.
| `PipelineBatch uint32` | Sets the batch size for the query pipeline.
| `PipelineCap uint32` | Sets the cap for the query pipeline.
| `Profile QueryProfileMode` | Allows to enable additional query profiling as part of the response.
| `ScanWait time.Duration` | Allows to specify a maximum scan wait time.
| `ScanCap uint32` | Specifies a maximum cap on the query scan size.
| `ScanConsistency QueryScanConsistency` | Sets a different scan consistency for this query.
|====

== Scan Consistency


Setting a staleness parameter for queries, with `scan_consistency`, enables a tradeoff between latency and (eventual) consistency.

* A N1QL query using the default *Not Bounded* scan consistency will not wait for any indexes to finish updating before running the query and returning results, meaning that results are returned quickly, but the query will not return any documents that are yet to be indexed.

* With Scan Consistency set to *RequestPlus*, all document changes and index updates are processed before the query is run.
Select this when consistency is always more important than performance.

* For a middle ground, *AtPlus* is a "read your own write" (RYOW) option, which means it just waits for the new documents that you specify to be indexed, rather than an entire index of multiple documents.
// See the xref:scan-consistency-examples.adoc[examples] for how to use *AtPlus* for the best performance balance for many circumstances.

== Streaming Large Result Sets

By default, the Python SDK will stream the result set from the server, where the client will start a persistent connection with the server and only read the header until the Rows are enumerated; then, each row or JSON object will be de-serialized one at a time.

This decreases pressure on Garbage Collection and helps to prevent OutOfMemory errors.
